# Hi!

I am a graduate student at Stony Brook University pursuing Master's in computer science, where I am affiliated with the CV lab and work with Prof. Haibin Ling. I previously did my Bachelors(Hons) in computer science from Indian Institute of Technology - Gandhinagar. I like to work on problems related to deep learning in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing. Recently, I am also exploring AI for drug discovery.
